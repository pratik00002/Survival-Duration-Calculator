# Survival-Duration-Calculator
The Survival Duration Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate the duration of time a person has lived based on their age. It allows users to input their age and select the desired time unit (e.g., Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds) to display the duration of their life in that unit.
